12 Bit adder is designed using 4 bit CLA logic (uploaded adder_12bit.v and tb_CLA12bit_newway.v)
Test bench is written to verify the design. 
Simulation is carried using iVerilog (uploaded 12 bit adder_simu.png).
Installed Openlane in Ubuntu 20.04 OS in the path /home/user/EICT_FDP/
Export path is established using the command - export PDK_ROOT=/home/user/EICT_FDP/
Installation of Docker command is checked by verifying in the path /home/user/EICT_FDP/openlane using command
    - sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) openlane:rc6 
If Docker window is installed properly, a Bash window will appear (uploaded bash_window.png)
The folder 'adder_12bit' created in /home/user/EICT_FDP/openlane/designs
Tested Verilog code (adder_12bit.v) is coped to the path  - /home/user/EICT_FDP/openlane/designs/adder_12bit/src
To test the design - ./flow.tcl -design adder_12bit -init_design_config (uploaded design_config.png)
To store the resulting temparory files - ./flow.tcl -design adder_12bit -tag test_eict -overwrite -interactive
If this step is success, we get the % symbol as the prompt(uploaded config_success.png)
For synthesis - run_synthesis (shows as successful - uploaded synthe_success.png)
For Floorplan creation - init_floorplan and 4-verilog2def_openroad.def is created and is opened from the location
 /home/user/EICT_FDP/openlane/designs/adder_12bit/runs/test_eict/tmp/floorplan using klayout (uploaded floorplan.png)
 To generate the power distribution network - gen_pdn -creates 4-pdn.def and is opened from the location
    /home/user/EICT_FDP/openlane/designs/adder_12bit/runs/test_eict/tmp/floorplan using klayout (uploaded pdn.png)
 To see the effect of power distribution network and to edit the floorplan.tcl file in   /home/user/EICT_FDP/openlane/configuration/ as
    Changed the Vpitch to 180 from the existing 153.6, 
    Hpitch  to 130 from the existing 153.18, 
    Voffset to 25 from the existing 16.32 , 
    Hoffset to 10 from the existing 16.65, 
    Core Ring to 1 from 0 
These commands run to see the changes - run_synthesis, init_floorplan, gen_pdn - 6-pdn.def is created (uploaded 6-pdn.png)
To place the input and output pins - place_io. Giving error and not able to resolve the error (uploaded place_io.png)
